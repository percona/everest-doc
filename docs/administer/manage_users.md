# Manage users in Percona Everest

Percona Everest provides user management capabilities, enabling you to securely log in through either the Percona Everest UI or the API.

Local user management involves administering Percona Everest users to ensure secure access to database resources. This encompasses tasks such as creating and deleting users, updating their passwords, etc.

When you install Percona Everest, an `admin` user is automatically created, granting full access to the system.

    We strongly recommend using [Single Sign-On (SSO) integration](../security/sso_idp_integration.md) for the production environment.


## Overview

All user accounts are stored in the YAML format within the `everest-accounts` Secret in the `everest-system` namespace:

??? example "User accounts: YAML format"
        
    ```{.text .no-copy}
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: everest-accounts
        namespace: everest-system
    data:                    
      users.yaml: YWRtaW46CiAgcGFzc3dvcmRIYXNoOiBhZG1pbgogIGVuYWJsZWQ6IHRydWUKICBjYXBhYmlsaXRpZXM6CiAgICAtIGxvZ2lu
    ```

Decoding the base64 encoded value will yield a YAML that appears as follows:


??? example "YAML after decoding"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    admin:
        passwordHash: <password>
    enabled: true
    capabilities:
        - login
    ```

## User management commands

This section provides a list of `everestctl` commands for managing users in Percona Everest.

### Retrieve password

You can retrieve the password for the `admin` user by running the following command:

```sh
everestctl accounts initial-admin-password
```

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"

    The passwords in this Secret are stored as hashes. However, the initial admin user has the password stored as plain text for convenient retrieval later on. We strongly recommend that you update the admin password after installation.



### Update the password

To update the password for an existing user:

```sh
everestctl accounts set-password -u <username>
```

You will be prompted to update the password.


??? example "Example"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    ? Enter new password **********
    ? Re-enter new password **********
    ```

### Create a new user

To create a new user:

```sh
everestctl accounts create -u <username>
```
You will be prompted to enter the password for this user.


??? example "Example"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    ? Enter new password **********
    P2024-06-27T08:11:34Z	info	cli/accounts.go:141	User 'rasika' has been created	{"component": "accounts"}
    ```

!!! info "Important"

    For Percona Everest versions 1.0.0 and later, new users have full access to the system. However, once RBAC support is in place, an admin user will be able to manage permissions for users, granting them fine-grained control over database resources.

For detailed information on granting permissions to new users, see [assign permissions to a new user](rbac.md#assign-users-to-a-group-and-grant-them-permissions) section.

### List the users

To list all the users in Percona Everest:

```sh
everestctl accounts list
```

### Delete a user

To delete an existing user:

```sh
everestctl accounts delete -u <username>
```


## JSON Web Token (JWT) and keys

When you log in from the UI, Percona Everest issues a JSON Web Token to authenticate the requests. By default, this token is valid for **24** hours, after which you are expected to log in again.


!!! info "Important"

    Since JWT authentication is stateless, it is currently impossible to explicitly revoke specific tokens. Therefore, even a deleted user may continue to request the API as long as they have a valid token.


The Everest API uses the RSA algorithm to sign and verify the JWT. The RSA key pair used for this is automatically generated upon installation and stored in the `everest-jwt` Secret in the `everest-system` namespace.

        apiVersion: v1
        data:
            id_rsa: <PRIVATE KEY>
            id_rsa.pub: <PUBLIC KEY>
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
            name: everest-jwt
            namespace: everest-system
        type: Opaque


To reset the key pair:
    
    everestctl accounts reset-jwt-keys
