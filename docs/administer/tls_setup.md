# TLS support for Percona Everest

The Percona Everest server now supports Transport Layer Security (TLS)  for all incoming connections. TLS **encrypts** client and server communication. This keeps data safe from being **intercepted or changed**. Administrators can configure server certificates and private keys to enable **secure HTTPS access** to the Everest API server. This strengthens security for production environments.


## TLS setup with Percona Everest

!!! info "Important"
    This section provides an example using **Helm**. You can also use the provided options with the Percona Everest CLI by using the flag `â€”helm.set`.



==== "Cert-manager (recommended)"
        ### Use cert-manager

    **Pre-requisites**

    Ensure that [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) has been deployed in your infrastructure.




Here are the steps to set up the Percona Everest server using Helm:
{.power-number}

1. Use self-signed certificates (automatically generated by the Percona Everest server):

    ```sh
    helm install everest-core percona/everest --create-namespace \
	-n everest-system \
	--set server.tls.enabled=true
    ```

2. Configure TLS with Custom Certificates.

    Create a configuration file named `values.yaml`:

    ```sh
    server:
	tls: 
		enabled: true
		secret:
			certs:
				tls.key: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
				tls.crt: YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE
    ```

3. To install Percona Everest with your custom certificates, use the following command:

    ```sh
    helm install everest-core percona/everest --create-namespace \
  -n everest-system \
  --set server.tls.enabled=true \
  -f values.yaml
    ```
