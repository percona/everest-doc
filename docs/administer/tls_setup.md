# TLS support for Percona Everest

The Percona Everest server now supports Transport Layer Security (TLS)  for all incoming connections. TLS **encrypts** client and server communication. This keeps data safe from being **intercepted or changed**. Administrators can configure server certificates and private keys to enable **secure HTTPS access** to the Everest API server. This strengthens security for production environments.
