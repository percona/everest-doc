# Create Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

## Prerequisites

Before creating an EKS cluster, make sure to:
{.power-number}

1. [Install the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) for interacting with the different parts of AWS.

2. [Install eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl#installation) to simplify cluster creation on EKS.

3. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to manage and deploy applications on Kubernetes.

4. [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with your credentials.

## Create the EKS cluster

To create the EKS cluster, do the following steps:
{.power-number}

1. Settled the required cluster details:

    * name of your EKS cluster
    * AWS region in which you wish to deploy your cluster
    * the number of nodes you would like to have
    * the desired ratio between [on-demand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html)
        and [spot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html) instances in the total number of nodes.

    !!! note

        [spot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html) instances are not recommended for production environment but may be useful for testing purposes.

2. Create your EKS cluster [following the official cluster creation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html).
3. [Install the Amazon EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html) on your cluster. See the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html) on adding it as an Amazon EKS add-on.

## Remove the EKS cluster

To delete your cluster, you will need the following data:

* name of your EKS cluster,
* AWS region in which you have deployed your cluster.

You can clean up the cluster with the following `eksctl` command (replace `<region>` and `<cluster name>` placeholders with real names):

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ eksctl delete cluster --region=<region> --name="<cluster name>"
```

The cluster deletion may take time.

!!! warning

    After deleting the cluster, all data stored in it will be lost!
