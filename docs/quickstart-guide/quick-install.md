{.power-number}

1. Install [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/install/index.html){:target="_blank"}.


2. Set up a Kubernetes cluster.
     
    !!! note alert alert-primary "Note"

        Percona Everest assists with installing all the necessary operators and required packages, but does not deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

       We recommend setting up Percona Everest on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
   
      [Create EKS cluster :material-arrow-right:](eks.md){.md-button}  [Create GKE cluster :material-arrow-right:](gke.md){.md-button}

3. Verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster that you want to use with Everest. By default, Everest uses the kubeconfig file available under `~/.kube/config`. 

     If your file is located elsewhere, use the export command below to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:
    
     ```sh
     export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
     ```

     To verify access to the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:
   
     ```sh
     kubectl get nodes
     ```

{.power-number}

1. Download and install Everest CLI.

    === "Linux and WSL"
                        
        ```sh
        curl -sSL -o everestctl-linux-amd64 https://github.com/percona/everest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-linux-amd64
        sudo install -m 555 everestctl-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
        rm everestctl-linux-amd64       
        ``` 

    === "macOS (Apple Silicon)"
                        
        ```sh
        curl -sSL -o everestctl-darwin-arm64 https://github.com/percona/everest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-darwin-arm64
        sudo install -m 555 everestctl-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
        rm everestctl-darwin-arm64      
        ```


    === "macOS (Intel CPU)"
                        
        ```sh
        curl -sSL -o everestctl-darwin-amd64 https://github.com/percona/everest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-darwin-amd64
        sudo install -m 555 everestctl-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
        rm everestctl-darwin-amd64        
        ``` 


2. Install Everest and provision the Kubernetes cluster:

    ```sh
    everestctl install
    ```

    Enter the specific names for the namespaces you want Everest to manage, separating each name with a comma.

    !!! warning "Important"
        -  Make sure that you enter at least one namespace.
        -  Ensure to copy the authorization token displayed on the terminal in this step. You will need this token to log in to the Percona Everest UI.    

3. Access the Everest UI/API using one of the following options for exposing it, as Everest is not exposed with an external IP by default:

    === "Service Type Load Balancer"

        * Use the following command to change the Everest service type to `LoadBalancer`:
                    
            ```sh
            kubectl patch svc/everest -n everest-system -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
            ```
                    
        * Retrieve the external IP address for the Everest service. This is the address where you can then launch Everest at the end of the installation procedure. In this example, the external IP address used is the default `127.0.0.1`:  
                
            ```sh 
            kubectl get svc/everest -n everest-system
            ```

    === "Port Forwarding"
        Run the following command to use `Kubectl port-forwarding` for connecting to Everest without exposing the service:
                
        ```sh
        kubectl port-forward svc/everest 8080:8080 -n everest-system
        ``` 

    Percona Everest will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
