# Welcome to Percona Everest

We are excited to welcome you to GA of Percona Everest, designed to demonstrate the core capabilities of our new open source cloud-native database platform!


## Why Percona Everest?

Percona Everest is the first open-source platform for automated database provisioning and management. It supports multiple database technologies and can be hosted on any Kubernetes infrastructure, in the cloud or on-premises.

Let's start by enabling you to deploy an automated private DBaaS, eliminating vendor lock-in and complex in-house platform development.
