# Quickstart guide

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    Although Percona Everest installs all the needed operators and packages, it does not spin up Kubernetes clusters.


This procedure simplifies the deployment of Everest instances, reducing the installation flow to running a single command.


## Prerequisites

To spin up an Everest instance, you first need to have a Kubernetes cluster that is publicly accessible.

We recommend setting one up on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), as it may be difficult to spin one up on local Kubernetes installations (minikube, kind, k3d, or similar products).


## Spin up a Percona Everest instance

To spin up a Percona Everest instance, run the following command:


    ```yaml
    curl -sfL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-everest-cli/v0.2.0/install.sh" | bash
    ```

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    Everest will search for the kubeconfig file in the `~/.kube/config`path. If your file is located elsewhere, add the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable before running the `install.sh` script:   
   
 ```yaml
curl -sfL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-everest-cli/v0.2.0/install.sh" | KUBECONFIG=<path/to/config/file> bash
```
