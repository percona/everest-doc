# Split-Horizon DNS for Percona Operator for MongoDB scenarios


## Create Split-Horizon DNS config

The Percona Everest administrator sets up a set of additional base domains and assigns TLS certificates to them in advance. This allows all Percona Everest users to access these domains later without needing to define custom additional domain names each time they create a Percona Operator for MongoDB cluster. To facilitate this, Percona Everest offers the option to create a Split-Horizon DNS configuration that defines the necessary relationships.
