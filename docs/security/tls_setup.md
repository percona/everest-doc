# TLS support for Percona Everest

Percona Everest can be configured to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all incoming connections to the Everest API server. TLS ensures that communication between clients and the API server is encrypted, protecting data from interception or tampering. Administrators can configure server certificates and private keys to enable **secure HTTPS access**, enhancing the overall security posture for production environments.

!!! note
    - When TLS is enabled, the default server port (8080) will only accept `https` traffic, and `http` traffic will be rejected.
    - We do not support redirects from `http` to `https`.
    - Self-signed certificates aren't trusted by most browsers, so it's best to use a trusted certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) in production.



## TLS setup with Percona Everest

!!! info "Important"
    This section provides an example using **Helm**. You can also use the provided options with `everestctl` by using the flag `--helm.set`.


### Use Cert-manager (recommended)     

#### Prerequisites

- Ensure that [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/){:target="_blank"} has been deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.

- Ensure that you have a properly configured **Issuer** or **ClusterIssuer** in place. See the [documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/){:target="_blank"} for details.


#### Set up Percona Everest using cert-manager

Here are the steps to set up the Percona Everest server using cert-manager:
{.power-number}


1. Create a configuration file named `values.yaml`:

    ```sh
    server:
	  tls: 
	    enabled: true
	    certificate:
	      create: true
	      domain: example.com
	      issuer:
			group: cert-manager.io
			kind: ClusterIssuer 
			name: your-cluster-issuer
    ```

    Replace **example.com** with your actual domain name.


2. Install Percona Everest using the above values:

    ```sh
    helm install everest-core percona/everest --create-namespace \
	-n everest-system \
	-f values.yaml
    ```

    ### Use self-signed certificates

    Use self-signed certificates (automatically generated during installation):
     

    ```sh
    helm install everest-core percona/everest --create-namespace \
	-n everest-system \
	--set server.tls.enabled=true
    ```

    ### Configure TLS with custom certificates

    Here are the steps to set up the Percona Everest server using custom certificates:
    {.power-number}

    1. Prepare your certificate public key (`tls.crt`) and private key (`tls.key`) files. 

    2. Create a configuration file named `values.yaml`:

        ```sh
        server:
          tls: 
            enabled: true
            secret:
              certs:
                tls.key: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
                tls.crt: YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` and `YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE` with the actual contents of your public and private key files.

    3. Install Percona Everest using the above values:

        ```sh
        helm install everest-core percona/everest --create-namespace \
        -n everest-system \
        -f values.yaml
        ```
