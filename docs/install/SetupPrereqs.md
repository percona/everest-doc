# Setup and prerequisites for manual installation

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    The installation instructions in this guide go through all the manual installation and provisioning steps. To get started with Percona Everest as quickly as possible, Percona provides a script that automatically performs most steps.

    [See Percona Everest QuickStart guide :material-arrow-right:](../quickstart-guide/quick-install.md){.md-button}

## Setup

Percona Everest has two primary components:

* [Percona Everest CLI](https://docs.percona.com/everest/install/installEverestCLI.html), which connects Percona Everest to your Kubernetes cluster.
* Percona Everest application with the UI, which you can spin up using the instructions below.

### Supported operators

* Percona Operator for MySQL Based on Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) 1.13.0
* Percona Operator for MongoDB (PSMDB) 1.15.0
* Percona Operator for PostgreSQL (PG) 2.3.1

### Supported k8s clusters

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (1.24 - 1.27)
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) (1.24 - 1.27)

## Before you install

Percona Everest assists with installing all the necessary operators and required packages, but does not currently help with spinning up a publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster.

We recommend setting up Percona Everest on the [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](../quickstart-guide/eks.md) or on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](../quickstart-guide/gke.md), as Percona Everest may not work as expected on local Kubernetes installations (minikube, kind, k3d, or similar products) due to network issues.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Percona Everest, we recommend that you:
{.power-number}

1. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html){:target="_blank"} for EKS or the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install){:target="_blank"} for GKE.
2. Verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster that you want to use with Everest. By default, Everest uses the kubeconfig file available under *~/.kube/config*. Run the following command:
    
    ```sh 
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"
        ```
            NAME                                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
            gke-<name>-default-pool-75d48bfc-bx8g      Ready    <none>   11h   v1.26.7-gke.500
            gke-<name>-default-pool-75d48bfc-c2df      Ready    <none>   11h   v1.26.7-gke.500
            gke-<name>-default-pool-75d48bfc-zl7k      Ready    <none>   11h   v1.26.7-gke.500
