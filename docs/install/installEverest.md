# Install Everest

## Before you start

Before running the commands in the **Installation** section, note that Everest will search for the kubeconfig file in the `~/.kube/config` path. If your file is located elsewhere, use the export command below to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable: 
    
```sh
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```

## Installation

To install and provision Percona Everest to Kubernetes:
{.power-number}

1. Download the latest release of [everestctl](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-cli/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} to provision Percona Everest. For detailed installation instructions, see [CLI installation documentation](../install/installEverestCLI).

2. Install Everest and provision the Kubernetes cluster using one of the following commands:
  
    ```sh
    everestctl install
    ```
    
    This will install all the required components in a namespace called `percona-everest`.

    ??? example "Example"
            
            ? Namespace to deploy Everest to percona-everest
            ? What operators do you want to install? MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
            

    Alternatively, you can install Everest and provision the Kubernetes cluster by running the installation in headless mode:
        
    ```
    everestctl install --operator.mongodb=true --operator.postgresql=true --operator.xtradb-cluster=true --skip-wizard
    ```

    !!! note alert alert-primary "Important"
        Ensure to copy the authorization token displayed on the terminal in this step. You will need this token to log in to the Percona Everest UI.    
    
    ### Limitations
        
    * If the Everest CLI fails to install the operators, do the following:
        
        * [Uninstall Percona Everest](uninstallEverest.md).
        
        * Install Percona Everest, starting with the second step.

    * If using a PMM Server instance with a self-signed certificate, you cannot use HTTPS in the PMM URL endpoint.

3. (Optional) Verify that the services have started properly:
    
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n percona-everest
    ```        
    ??? example "Expected output"
        ```
        NAME                                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        percona-xtradb-cluster-operator-75c9b976cf-jl9j6      1/1     Running     0          10s
        percona-server-mongodb-operator-79b9668cd5-d7srk      1/1     Running     0          10s
        percona-postgresql-operator-84947f45cc-2rb2w          1/1     Running     0          10s
        percona-everest-5c896598d9-99jnr                      1/1     Running     0          10s
        everest-operator-controller-manager-75b59869c-8jx47   2/2     Running     0          10s
        ```

4. Access the Everest UI/API using one of the following options for exposing it, as Everest is not exposed with an external IP by default:

    === "Port Forwarding"

        Run the following command to use `Kubectl port-forwarding` for connecting to Everest without exposing the service:
        
        ```sh
        kubectl port-forward svc/everest 8080:8080 -n percona-everest
        ``` 

    === "Service Type Load Balancer"

        * Use the following command to change the Everest service type to `LoadBalancer`:
            
        ```sh
        kubectl patch svc/everest -n percona-everest -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
        ```
            
        * Retrieve the external IP address for the Everest service. This is the address where you can then launch Everest at the end of the installation procedure. In this example, the external IP address used is the default `127.0.0.1`:  
        
        ```sh 
        kubectl get svc/everest -n percona-everest
        ```
            
        ??? example "Expected output"
            ```
            NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
            everest   LoadBalancer   10.43.172.194   127.0.0.1       8080:31611/TCP   10s
            ```

5. To launch the Everest UI and create your first database cluster, go to the IP address configured for the Everest service in step 4. In this example, this is [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
