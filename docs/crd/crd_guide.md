# Percona Everest operator Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

The Percona **Everest operator** is a crucial component of Percona. It provides a set of CRDs and easy-to-use abstractions to manage your databases declaratively. 

This guide will walk you through the CRDs provided by the Percona Everest operator and how to use them effectively.


## When to use CRDs

We **recommend** using the **Percona Everest UI or API** for most operations. 

The Perocna Everest UI/API provides the following benefits:

- Built-in validation and guardrails
- A complete DBaaS-like experience
- Simplified management of complex operations
- Enhanced security and access control
    
Use CRDs directly only when you need fine-grained control or are integrating with other Kubernetes tools.
