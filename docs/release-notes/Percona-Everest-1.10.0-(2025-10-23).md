## üåü Release highlights

=== "Split-Horizon DNS for MongoDB"
    ### Seamless access with Split-Horizon DNS for MongoDB
    Starting with Percona Everest 1.10.0, we've rolled out a new feature: **Split-Horizon DNS for Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB)**.  This feature  enables database administrators to¬†expose ReplicaSet Pods¬†with custom domain names, both inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster, without conflicting with the default DNS configuration.

    ### Why Split-Horizon DNS matters?
    Database administrators may sometimes need to expose ReplicaSet Pods in a Percona Operator for MongoDB cluster so they can connect to them directly. This applies both inside and outside the Kubernetes environment, using custom domain names instead of the default ones generated during cluster creation.

    This is useful in scenarios such as:

    - Performing maintenance tasks, like copying data from one ReplicaSet to another cluster.

    - Providing temporary or alternative domain names for direct Pod access without impacting the default DNS configuration.

=== "NodePort exposure type"
    ### Direct database access via NodePort
    [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport)  is a Kubernetes service type that enables access to a database using NODE_IP:NODE_PORT. With NodePort, each node in the cluster opens a port that redirects incoming requests to the database.

    ### Why use NodePort?
    Here are the benefits of using NodePort:

    - NodePort is straightforward to configure and requires minimal setup.

    - It is useful for quick testing or exposing services without a full Ingress or LoadBalancer setup.

    - Allows clients to access a service directly using `NODE_IP:NODE_PORT`.

    - It is useful for development, debugging, or custom environments where service routing is limited.

=== "Operators support"
    ### Operators support

    - Percona Everest now supports Percona PostgreSQL Operator v2.7.0.

    - Percona Everest now supports Percona Server for MongoDB Operator v1.21.0.

    - Percona Everest now supports Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator v1.18.0.

## Improvements

- [EVEREST-1853](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1853): Percona Everest now supports Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) v3, giving you access to the latest monitoring, alerting, and performance insights. PMM v2 remains supported for backward compatibility.

- [EVEREST-1889](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1889): The **Overview ‚Üí Resources** section now displays the number of nodes per shard, providing a clearer understanding of resource allocation in sharded deployments at a glance.


- [EVEREST-2236](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2236) Expose proxy vars in helm values

- [EVEREST-2302](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2302): Menu informational sections are now displayed as plain text. They no longer behave like actions (clickable or hoverable), improving clarity and reducing confusion.

- [EVEREST-2318](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2318): The dropdown option **Load Balancer** has been renamed to **LoadBalancer** to align with other service types, such as **ClusterIP** and **NodePort**.

- [EVEREST-2323](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2323): The DB Importers UI now displays credentials in the same order as they appear in Kubernetes secrets and documentation, ensuring a consistent workflow across CLI, docs, and UI.


## Bug fixes

- [EVEREST-1741](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1741): Fixed an issue where deleting a database changed the **Actions** menu's background color to blue.


- [EVEREST-1865](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1865): **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) details** are now displayed correctly when editing PostgreSQL database clusters.

- [EVEREST-1947](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1947): Fixed an issue where the **Copy URL to Clipboard** button in the database details view was not working. Users can now successfully copy the connection URL.


- [EVEREST-2023](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2023): The `everest operator` showed inconsistent behavior in handling resource creation and updates. This issue has now been resolved.


- [EVEREST-2104](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2104): The restore operations were previously stuck in the **Restoring** state when the associated backup was deleted. This issue has now been resolved, and restores fail gracefully, providing a clear error message.


- [EVEREST-2109](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2109): Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) now correctly activates for PostgreSQL clusters after creating on-demand or scheduled backups, addressing the previous issue where it remained disabled.

- [EVEREST-2121](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2121): Resolved an issue where backup data was deleted along with the database cluster, even when the delete data option was unchecked. Backup storage now remains intact, ensuring data safety and recoverability.


- [EVEREST-2135](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2135): Addressed an issue where the S3 bucket field accepted incorrect formats and the **Verify TLS** option was unchecked by default. Input validation now ensures the correct S3 formats, and TLS verification is enabled by default.


- [EVEREST-2163](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2163): The Pod Scheduling Policy now appears in the **Edit Advanced Configuration** view even when no rules are defined.

- [EVEREST-2211](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2211): PostgreSQL databases now start successfully following a Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR). Previously, clusters would crash after a PITR operation.


- [EVEREST-2235](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2235): Specifying an invalid `.spec.engine.version` in a `DatabaseCluster` CRD no longer crashes the Percona Everest Operator. Invalid versions are now handled gracefully with proper validation and error reporting.

- [EVEREST-2237](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2237): Creating a database via **CRD** without specifying monitoring resources no longer causes the **Overview** page to crash. The page now loads correctly even if monitoring resources are omitted.

- [EVEREST-2258](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2258): When editing the database and enabling the load balancer, the **Host** field was updated after a few seconds, but the **Connection URL** did not update. We have resolved the issue now.



- [EVEREST-2278](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2278): Percona Everest now correctly manages SSO token expiration, enabling users to continue without clearing their browser cookies.


- [EVEREST-2290](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2290): The **Add New** button in Load balancer config is now disabled until the previous annotation row is filled when creating or editing the load balancer configuration, thereby improving the user experience.

- [EVEREST-2311](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2311): The warning for deleting a Load balancer config now clearly states that it can only be deleted if it is not linked to any database, ensuring no impact on the existing databases.

- [EVEREST-2324](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2324): Fixed an issue where the `everestctl upgrade` command did not permit upgrading to the next patch version if a newer minor release is available.
