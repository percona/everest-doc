## Release highlights

=== "Helm charts"
    ### Simplify your Percona Everest deployments with Helm

    We are excited to announce the launch of Helm charts in Percona Everest 1.4.0. [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) simplify the deployment process by packaging all necessary resources and configurations, making them ideal for automating and managing installations in Kubernetes environments.

    Percona Helm charts can be found in [percona/percona-helm-charts]( https://github.com/percona/percona-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/everest){:target="_blank"} repository in Github.

    If you are looking to get started with Percona Everest using Helm, check out our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/install/install_everest_helm_charts.html).

    Additionally, check our [Upgrade](https://docs.percona.com/everest/upgrade/upgrade_with_helm.html) and [Uninstall](https://docs.percona.com/everest/uninstall/uninstall_everest_helm.html) sections to find out how to upgrade or uninstall your Percona Everest instances using Helm.    

=== "Namespaces management"

    ### Manage your namespaces with new everestctl commands

    Namespace management is essential in Percona Everest for efficiently organizing, securing, and allocating resources, particularly in large and complex Kubernetes environments. By leveraging Kubernetes namespaces, Percona Everest achieves logical isolation, enhanced security, and better resource allocation for databases, backups, and monitoring setups.


    Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, we have introduced new `everestctl` commands to manage your namespaces. These commands enable you to:
        
    - [Add new namespaces](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/manage_namespaces.html#add-new-namespaces)
    - [Update existing namespaces](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/manage_namespaces.html#update-namespaces)
    - [Delete any used namespaces](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/manage_namespaces.html#delete-namespaces)

    For a deep dive into managing namespaces for provisioning DB namespaces in Percona Everest, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/manage_namespaces.html).

=== "Improved edit database flow"

    ### Removal of the Edit DB Wizard for an enhanced User Experience

    Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, we have removed the **Edit DB** wizard to provide a more streamlined user experience. You can now edit specific fields directly from the **DB Overview** page using our new editable widgets, eliminating the need to navigate through the entire **Edit DB** wizard.

    ![!image](../images/remove_edit_db_wizard.png)

     Let's assume you want to make changes to **Point-in-time-Recovery (PITR)**. First, navigate to the specific database. Then, go to **Overview > Point-in-time-Recovery (PITR)** and click **Edit**. Make the necessary changes and click **Save**.

    ![!image](../images/remove_db_wizard_edit_resource_widget.png)

=== "Operators support"

    ### Support for PSMDB 1.18.0 and PG 2.5.0


    Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, we are thrilled to announce that we have added support for PSMDB Operator v1.18.0 and PG operator v2.5.0.

## Google Container Registry (GCR)

!!! warning "GCR deprecation"
    GCR is set to be **deprecated**, with its official shutdown scheduled for **May 20, 2025**.

    All Percona Everest versions prior to 1.4.0 depend on images hosted on Google Container Registry (GCR). These images will become unavailable after the shutdown date: **March 18, 2025**.

### Impact of GCR deprecation

Percona Everest versions older than 1.4.0 will cease to function after this date.

### Action required

We strongly recommend upgrading to Percona Everest version 1.4.0 or later as soon as possible. If you do not upgrade, Percona Everest will no longer function.
    
For more details, refer to the [Container Registry Deprecation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/prepare-gcr-shutdown){:target="_blank"}.

## Improvements

- [EVEREST-1065](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1065): Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, we have removed the **Edit** button from the database list actions. This change provides a more streamlined user experience, allowing you to edit the database directly from the database **Overview** page without having to go through the entire edit wizard.


- [EVEREST-1066](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1066): We have improved the **Backups & PITR** widget on the database **Overview** page. With this enhancement, you can now directly enable or disable PITR by clicking **Edit** from this page.

- [EVEREST-1210](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1210): The **Advanced Configuration** panel on the **DB Details** widget is now more user-friendly than ever. You can  edit or enable parameters directly from the database **Overview** page. Just click **Edit**, and and make your changes with ease.

- [EVEREST-1304](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1304): We have simplified the create database wizard. When you click **Create Database**, a menu with the **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB** options will appear under the button. After selecting a database type, you will be guided to the wizard with the chosen value pre-set.

- [EVEREST-1546](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1546): You can see the number of proxies, routers, and bouncers, along with their resources, directly on the **Database Summary** and **Overview** pages. This enhancement provides greater visibility into the resources within your clusters.

- [EVEREST-1683](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1683): The **Backups** on the **Overview** page are organized in descending order, making it easier to find your most recent backups by their start date and time.

- [EVEREST-1686](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1686): We've adopted a 24-hour time format for our backups and restores to eliminate any potential confusion and ensure consistency across Percona Everest.

- [EVEREST-1687](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1687): The label for the upgrade CRD button has been shortened to improve readability.  

- [EVEREST-1701](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1701): Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, when configuring RBAC policies, the resource name for `database-cluster-backups` now corresponds to the database name instead of the backup name. This change allows for a more intuitive configuration of permissions for backups at the database level.


- [EVEREST-1702](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1702): Starting with Percona Everest 1.4.0, when configuring RBAC policies, the resource name for `database-cluster-restores` now corresponds to the database name instead of the restore name. This change allows for a more intuitive configuration of permissions for backups at the database level.

## Bugs

- [EVEREST-1688](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1688): If a user changed the value for the number of shards and then scrolled down, the number of shards would unexpectedly increase. Conversely, if they scrolled up, the number of shards would decrease. The value did not remain constant, and similar behavior was observed in other fields as well. This issue has been resolved now, and the values for the fields remain constant.

- [EVEREST-1187](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1187): We’ve resolved the issue that prevented Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) from being enabled for the PostgreSQL database after setting up backup schedules on the **Backups** page.

- [EVEREST-1235](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1235), [EVEREST-1254](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1254): `everestctl` now provides relevant error messages when using the `install` command, helping you identify any issues that occurred during the installation process. For instance, if the kubeconfig is unavailable, the cluster configuration is incorrect, or the cluster cannot be connected to, `everestctl` will display an appropriate error message.

- [EVEREST-1254](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1254): During the uninstallation of Percona Everest, an unusual error code appeared at the end of the process. The issue has been resolved now.

- [EVEREST-1320](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1320): The warning message for a gap in Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is now shown on both the **Backups** and **Restores** pages. Additionally, when the database is up and running, a triangle icon on the dashboard page now correctly directs you to the **Backups** page.

- [EVEREST-1352](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1352): To ensure data integrity, all database actions are now disabled while the database is in a **Deleting** state.

- [EVEREST-1399](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1399): The **Resource per node** now accurately displays the value set during database creation. Previously, there was a mismatch between the value chosen at setup and what was shown when editing the database. Instead, it defaulted to **Custom**, which was not the initial selection. 

- [EVEREST-1407](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1407): We've resolved an issue where a user lacking the necessary RBAC permissions could access specific information in Percona Everest.

- [EVEREST-1440](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1440): We've resolved an issue that caused a delay while loading the **Backups** page. Furthermore, the **Add Storage** option was displayed on the **Backups** page even though the user did not have backup storage permissions.

- [EVEREST-1518](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1518), [EVEREST-1604](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1604): We've resolved an issue that permitted users to view and edit DB clusters, as well as restore to the same DB cluster, even if they lacked the necessary permissions for the database engine(s).

- [EVEREST-1534](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1534) The **Database clusters** page was empty for users with access to only one database cluster. This issue has now been resolved.

- [EVEREST-1565](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1565): The MongoDB versions are now sorted in descending order, and all the versions are visible on the **Basic information** page when selecting the **Database version**.

- [EVEREST-1593](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1593): We’ve resolved an issue that was preventing the display name and database version from showing up during a new cluster creation.

- [EVEREST-1594](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1594): Scheduled backups failed after several successful runs when the number of shards in the MongoDB sharded cluster was modified. This issue has been resolved now.

- [EVEREST-1608](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1608): Percona Everest now displays an error message if the **Proxies** value in the **Custom** field for the MySQL database is not entered. Also, unless you enter this value, the **Continue** button is disabled, which aligns with the expected behavior.

- [EVEREST-1613](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1613): On the **Edit Topology** page, the **Resource Size per Node** field now displays the initially selected configuration. Previously, when reopening the **Edit Topology** page, the setting would revert to **Custom** instead of retaining the chosen option.

- [EVEREST-1615](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1615): We have fixed an issue where the uninstallation of Percona Everest failed if a MongoDB sharded cluster was in the **Deleting** state.

- [EVEREST-1642](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1642): When restoring to a new database, modifying its version is no longer possible. This behavior aligns with the expected functionality of Percona Everest.

- [EVEREST-1649](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1649): We've addressed an issue that caused the **Add storage** button for backups to remain inactive, even after the page was refreshed. The button would only become active when users switched between different tabs, such as transitioning from the **Overview** tab to the **Backups** tab.

- [EVEREST-1650](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1650): We have resolved an issue on the **Backups** page where the button incorrectly displayed **Add storage** instead of **Create backup** after adding new storage. This prevented users from creating backups. The issue occurred when trying to add backup storage in a namespace other than the one where the database was originally created (the default namespace).

- [EVEREST-1694](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1694): The **Backup storages** page was appearing empty for users with access to only one backup storage. This issue has now been resolved.

- [EVEREST-1695](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1695): The **Monitoring endpoints** page was empty for users with access to only one monitoring instance. This issue has now been resolved.

- [EVEREST-1703](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1703): While setting up a MongoDB sharded cluster in Percona Everest, an error occurred during the topology step. If only **1** config server was selected, an error message appeared, stating that the number of config servers must be greater than one. However, when the config server setting was changed to **3** or any other value, the “Next” button became grayed out, preventing progress to the next step. The issue has been resolved now.

- [EVEREST-1712](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-1712): We've resolved an issue where the Percona Everest UI pages became unresponsive after some time. None of the page elements worked, and the only solution was to close the page and start a new browser session.


## Known limitations

- In Percona Operator for PostgreSQL version 2.5.0, backups start failing after a minor version upgrade from PostgreSQL 16.3 to 16.4 if **monitoring is enabled** on the database. 

    **Workaround** 

    Once you upgrade your PostgreSQL version, it’s essential to also update the `pg_stat_monitor` extension by executing the following command:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor UPDATE;
    ```

- The backup storage you choose for your initial backup schedule will be used for all subsequent schedules and point-in-time recovery (PITR).

- When creating a 1-node MongoDB cluster, the cluster temporarily enters an **Error** state instead of **Initializing** before transitioning to the **Ready** state.

- When restoring a MySQL database from a backup, the process may fail if the database name is too long. Use a shorter name for the restored database.
