## üåü Release highlights

===  "‚éà Affinity"


    ### Database Affinity rules for optimized Kubernetes scheduling
    
    The DB Affinity Rules feature provides database administrators with enhanced control over the distribution of database workloads within a Kubernetes cluster. By configuring Kubernetes affinity and anti-affinity rules, you can optimize performance, improve resilience, and utilize resources more efficiently‚Äîcustomized to the architecture and components of each database.

    This feature covers three key areas of affinity rule management throughout the database lifecycle:

    - **Reusable Affinity Policies** ‚Äì Create shared policies that can be reused by many DB clusters.
    - **Policy selection during database deployment** ‚Äì Select the appropriate policy during the database creation process.
    **Affinity management and status monitoring** ‚Äì Modify affinity settings for specific components in existing cluster, as well as quickly monitor the status from the database overview page.
    
    These capabilities offer a robust toolkit for defining and maintaining workload distribution strategies across all supported database engines: MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

=== "üîê TLS support"

    ### Improved Security with TLS support

    Starting with Percona Everest 1.7.0, Percona Everest can be configured to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all incoming connections to the Everest API server. TLS ensures that client and API server communication is encrypted, protecting data from interception or tampering. 
    
    Administrators can configure server certificates and private keys to enable¬†**secure HTTPS access**, enhancing the overall security posture for production environments.


=== "Session management"



=== ":simple-postgresql: Expanded PostgreSQL support"

    ### Support for PostgreSQL Operator 2.6.0 and PostgreSQL 17

    Percona Everest 1.6.0 now includes support for Percona Operator for PostgreSQL 2.6.0 and PostgreSQL 17.


## üõë Google Container Registry (GCR)

!!! warning "GCR deprecation"
    GCR is set to be **deprecated**, with its official shutdown scheduled for **May 20, 2025**.

    All Percona Everest versions prior to 1.4.0 depend on images hosted on the Google Container Registry (GCR). These images will become unavailable after the shutdown date: **May 20, 2025**.

### Impact

Percona Everest versions older than 1.4.0 will cease to function after this date.

### Action required

We strongly recommend upgrading to Percona Everest version 1.4.0 or later as soon as possible. If you do not upgrade, Percona Everest will no longer function.
    
For more details, refer to the [Container Registry Deprecation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/prepare-gcr-shutdown){:target="_blank"}.
