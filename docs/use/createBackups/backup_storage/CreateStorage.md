# Create backup storage

Before working with backups, create a backup storage location as a backup destination for creating and storing your backup artifacts.  

Everest supports S3-compatible backup locations, which means you can use [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or any other storage solutions that support S3 API, like [min.io](https://min.io/).

     - Currently, Everest does not support S3 buckets with S3 Object Lock. Make sure your backup destination you are registering does not have S3 Object Lock enabled.

     - Make sure you have read/write/delete permissions to the S3 bucket.
