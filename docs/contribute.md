We welcome all kinds of contributions so here's how you can get involved:

- Submit bug reports or feature requests

## Submit a bug report or feature request

If you find a bug in Percona Everest, you can submit a report via the [Percona  Everest Community Forum](https://forums.percona.com). 
Start by searching the open topics for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already reported the same issue, you can upvote that report to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:
{.power-number}

1. Sign in to [Percona Everest Forum](https://forums.percona.com). You will need to create an account if you do not have one.

2. Create a report that:      
      *  describes the steps to reproduce the issue
      *  includes the version of Percona Everest, your environment, and so on
      *  has not been reported already 
      *  is scoped to a single bug

## Contribute to Percona Everest code

If you’d like to submit a code patch, follow the [Contributing guide in Everest code repository](https://github.com/percona/everest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contribute to Percona Everest documentation

Found a typo or didn't find what you needed? Here's how you can contribute to the documentation:
{.power-number}

1. **Request a doc change through a Jira issue**. If you’ve spotted a doc issue (a typo, broken links, inaccurate instructions, etc.) but don’t have time nor desire to fix it yourself - let us know about it.

	- Click the **Jira** link in the contact us section. This opens the [Jira issue tracker](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/EVEREST/boards/65).
	- Sign in (create a Jira account if you don’t have one) and click **Create** to create an issue.
	- Describe the issue you have detected in the Summary, Description, Steps To Reproduce, Affects Version fields.

2. **Contribute to documentation directly**. 

    To contribute to the documentation, you should be familiar with the following technologies:

    * [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) markup language. We write the documentation in it.
    * [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

    The `.md` files are in the `docs/` directory. 

    **Edit documentation online via GitHub.**
    
    * Select the pencil icon next to the page title to open the source file in the GitHub editor. If you haven’t worked with the repository before, GitHub creates a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of it for you.

    * Edit the page. You can check your changes on the **Preview** tab.

    * Commit your changes:

	     * In the *Commit changes* section, describe your changes.
	     * Select the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option.
	     * Click **Propose changes**.

    * GitHub creates a branch and a commit for your changes. It loads a new page on which you can open a pull request to Percona. The page shows the base branch - the one you offer your changes for, your commit message and a diff - a visual representation of your changes against the original page. This allows you to make a last-minute review. When you are ready, click the **Create pull request** button.
    
    * Someone from our team reviews the pull request and if everything is correct, merges it into the documentation. Then it gets published on the site.
